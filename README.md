This code is an adaption of the https://towardsdatascience.com/predicting-premier-league-odds-from-ea-player-bfdb52597392 soccer prediction model.

The input.csv file contains all the games from 2014 to 2017 from Brasileir√£o tournament. 

It's a 36 column vector that works as explained in the link, but, instead of data from fifa, it's the data extracted from who scored.

The output is the score of the game. Two columns with home_goal and away_goal.
